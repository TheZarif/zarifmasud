Hi! I’m **Zarif Masud**, a PhD candidate at **Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)**, co-supervised by **Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri** and **Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed**. My research sits at the intersection of **Responsible AI**, **Information Retrieval (IR)**, and **migration studies**. I audit how search/retrieval systems frame immigration-related content, with a focus on **dataset bias, discursive framing, and accountability**.

**Research interests:** IR bias & fairness · framing analysis in IR datasets (MS MARCO v1.1/v2.1, Reddit, Hansard) · transparency & accountability for AI in immigration · evaluation methods and auditing.

### Current projects
- **IR bias & framing audits:** Multi-label framing taxonomy + LLM/lexicon pipelines to analyze query/passages; comparisons across rerankers.
- **AI & immigration book chapter:** Risks, safeguards, and governance (transparency, due process, human rights).
- **Data Observatory:** AI-assisted scraping/curation for immigration discourse (agents, Supabase backend, PDF capture).

### Selected highlights
- Methods for **discursive auditing** of retrieval outputs (frames, valence, stereotypes), complementing structural metrics.
- Practical pipelines with **Pandas, Pyserini, SentenceTransformers, FAISS**, and local LLM inference via **Ollama**.
